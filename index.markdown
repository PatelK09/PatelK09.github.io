## Education
---
**University of Manitoba**, *Bachelor of Computer Science*
* January 2020 - Present
* **Expected Graduation:** May 2025

## Project  
---
**Event Driven Simulation**, C++ (Academic Project) *(March 2022)*
* A discrete-event simulation to simulate a restaurant chef handling food order. Three 
different simulations to handle food Orders
* Accomplished using all the facilities for doing Object Orientation in C++ like appropriate 
use of abstract classes and methods, and safe dynamic casting and each class have 
separate implementation from its interface.
* Using Command line arguments to take input of filename and the version of the simulation 
to run. Process file data and run the simulation based on version input.  

**Poker Game**, Java (Academic Project) *(February 2022)*
* A version of poker called 5-card draw human vs CPU game with normal GUI and two CPU 
player, AI (smart) and normal.
* Implemented game logic and additional objects. Designed a set of classes that are
implementing some interfaces.
* Ensuring the safe connection between classes and the GUI and maintained all Object Oriented features.   

**Database**, Python & SQL (Academic Project) *(December 2021)*
* A database of used cars with a graphical user interface to answer interesting questions 
using pre-defined quires.
* Cleaned data using pandas library and normalized the data to the highest normal form to 
design and structure the tables in most efficient way. 
* Accomplished it everything using python, sqlite3 and PyQt5 library.  

**John Conway’s Game of Life**, C (Academic Project) *(July 2021)*
* Simulation of game of life in C allowing user to input a starting configuration of live cells.
* User can watch the cell grow and change over the generation and can detect is there is 
any cycle in generations.
* Using Command line arguments to take input of filename in which initial configuration of 
live cells is given  

## Project
